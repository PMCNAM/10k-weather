## Description

This ultra-lightweight (<4kb initial load, <8kb with weather data and gzip enabled) weather web-app lets you check the current weather conditions anywhere in the world. It works with and without javascript and does not have any dependencies other than the weather api.

## Demo

## How it Works

The weather data is provided by a free api from openweathermap.org. To get an API key go to http://openweathermap.org/appid and sign up for free. Once you have a key, edit the first line of scripts.js:

`var wxAppId = "3XAMPLK3YW1THL3TT3RSANDNUMB3RS";`
